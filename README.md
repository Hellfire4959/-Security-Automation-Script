# Security-Automation-Script
Python script that automates some common security tasks.

Notes:

Customize the verify_ssl_certificates and monitor_system_logs functions to perform the specific tasks you need.
You can schedule this script to run periodically using tools like cron (on Unix-based systems) or Task Scheduler (on Windows).
Feel free to enhance this script by adding more security-related tasks or integrating it with other tools.
